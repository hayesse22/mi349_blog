      <h2>About Me!</h2>
      <p>My name is Sean Hayes and I love writing content regarding sports, especially the NBA. Since being a toddler, I've always been a fan of Sports especially Boston Sports, due to living in Massachusetts. However, after being at Michigan State I've started to root for Detroit sports as well, as long as they aren't playing Boston. My father is who got me into watching sports, I have fond memories of being a kid watching Super Bowls and NBA Finals with him even before I understood what anything meant. Over the years, my love for sports has carried over into website desing, hence why I created a sports blog. My interest for web design started when I had my first coding class at MSU, although hard, I really enjoyed it. I am a Senior in my last semester of summer classes at Michigan State University, you can see a photo of me above which is on the day I walked across the stage. However, once I'm done with the 2 classes I'm currently taking, I will be fully graduated. Visit the contact page if you have any questions or would like to get in touch with me!</p>
