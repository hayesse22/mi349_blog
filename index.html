      <h2>NBA Finals Prediction</h2>
      <article class="blogpost">
        <h3>Who's going to win the trophy?</h3>

          <p>The upcoming NBA Finals features the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers. The star for the Thunder just recently won the MVP award, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who is looking to finish his season with an even bigger trophy. As for Indiana, Tyrese Haliburton is coming off an incredible postseason run helping the Pacers catch fire at the perfect time. The Thunder have one of the best defenses of all time and the Pacers are one of the fastest paced teams ever, no pun intended, but this means this matchup will be extraordinary to watch. Also, both teams are really well-rounded from top to bottom so every game should be exiting and close. As for the Pacers, they have overcome odds the whole playoffs, beating a 4 seed, a 1 seed, and just recently the 3 seed. They are the 5th seed, and were expected to lose in the second round. Game 1 of this series is on June 5 at 8:30PM don't miss out!</p>
          <p>For me personally, I hope the Pacers win, always have to root for the underdog. However, I do think the Oklahoma City Thunder will win in 6 games, with the series score being 4-2. The defense for the Thunder is too formidible for the Pacers to overcome, although with their fast-paced play, the Pacers still have a chance.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, if you are a Celtics fan, the season did not end the way you wish it did. The Celtics fell short to the New York Knicks, who just recently lost to Indiana in the Conference Finals. Also, Tatum had injured himself in the last game of their season, who likely won't see the court all of next year. Even with this wave of "bad luck", the Celtics still have a great chance to keep their team together, or if they wanted to, could easily trade players away due to how much good talent is on the team all together. There's speculation going around that Jaylen Brown might get traded, who if traded, would bring back a lot of talent in return. However, this likely would upset many fans as he's been on the team the second longest. In my opinion, I think the Celtics should keep the team they currently have constructed, due to just recently winning the NBA Finals just last season. There's an issue though, multiple players on the team make tens of millions of dollars a year, this makes it tough on the organization to pay all the salaries at once. A trade is likely going to occur due to that, I just hope the team makes good decisions if they do decide to.</p>
