        <p>The upcoming NBA Finals features the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers. The star for the Thunder just recently won the MVP award, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who is looking to finish his season with an even bigger trophy. As for Indiana, Tyrese Haliburton is coming off an incredible postseason run helping the Pacers catch fire at the perfect time. The Thunder have one of the best defenses of all time and the Pacers are one of the fastest paced teams ever, no pun intended, but this means this matchup will be extraordinary to watch. Also, both teams are really well-rounded from top to bottom so every game should be exiting and close. As for the Pacers, they have overcome odds the whole playoffs, beating a 4 seed, a 1 seed, and just recently the 3 seed. They are the 5th seed, and were expected to lose in the second round. Game 1 of this series is on June 5 at 8:30PM don't miss out!</p>

        <p>For me personally, I hope the Pacers win, always have to root for the underdog. However, I do think the Oklahoma City Thunder will win in 6 games, with the series score being 4-2. The defense for the Thunder is too formidible for the Pacers to overcome, although with their fast-paced play, the Pacers still have a chance.</p>
